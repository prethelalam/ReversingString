I built a program that is able to reverse a String.

I utilized a text editor called VS studio code to build a program that is able to reverse a string. My intial intention was to reverse a string array. However, I broke down the program in steps in order to get to that point The program will allow a user to enter a string, which will be reversed. The first step was simply reversing a string, the second step was reversing an integer array, and the last step was reversing a string array.

## Problems I ran into and how I solved them:
The first problem I encourted was during the first step (reversing a string). I was not too sure how to reverse each letter, where hello would print as olleh.

I was able to solve this issue by creating a for loop and extracting each character in the string in the for loop. Then I was able to set up a variable where I added each letter of the character in front of the existing string. Next I was able to print the string in reverse order. The second issue I encountered was
